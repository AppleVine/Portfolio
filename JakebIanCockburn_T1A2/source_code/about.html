                    <p>The BA of Biomedical Science provided me with a strong foundation of knowledge in the subjects of chemistry,
                        biology, mathematics through both coursework and dedicated laboratory classes while also developing practical
                        workplace skills such as time management, communication, and teamwork.</p>

                    <p>
                        Throughout the places I've studied I've picked up other qualifications where I can apply the education & skills learned. During highschool I completed a Certificate II in workplace practices allowing me to learn skills, behaviour and laws of workplaces. While working at McDonalds I completed a Certificate III in Retail management training me on various skills and company knowledge to effectively work with my team and manage other staff, myself and customers.

                    <p>At Recochem I was rapidly trained in a broad range of quality &amp; technical projects, beginning with standard bench
                        tests for a massive range of solvents and coolants, then further learning about these products to provide technical
                        advice to customers, clients, and sales representatives along with production staff . The job progressed to include
                        working in other fields of quality control such as updating/creating product labels, Safety Data Sheets,
                        Manufacturing Specification Sheets, data processing, customer service, product development along with projects to
                        improve the department.</p>

                    <p> As a CSO for Services Australia we were contracted month by month for emergency support of Australia during the
                        pandemic. We were rapidly trained in numerous systems, programs, legislation, and communication skills as we
                        learned to assist in Centrelink, Medicare, MyGov and Australian Immunization Register enquiries. This role had
                        multiple KPI tracking available for us where I consistently kept 100% accuracy, over 100% in performance (based
                        on time working) and received numerous customer compliments without any complaints over this period.</p>

                    <p>In my spare time I like a few different activities. When I'm trying to unwind I like playing video games online with my friends, if I'm feeling more focused then I can work on music projets learning new songs on the piano. If you can't tell from this website I love cats quite a lot, even if mine is quite mischevious.</p>
